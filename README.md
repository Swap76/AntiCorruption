# AntiCorruption
Government introduces new schemes and invests large amount of money for betterment of our country. But most of the money does not get into the hands of the correct authorities or needies. If we develop a transparent system where we can track the flow of money completely, this will eliminate the corruption which is root cause of our underdeveloped and underachieving society.
